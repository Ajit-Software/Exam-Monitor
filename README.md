# About the Project 
ExamMonitor is a system that helps manage offline college exams more easily and efficiently using QR codes. We built this project to solve common problems students face during exams like confusion and long lines to check seat numbers on notice boards.
With ExamMonitor, students get their seat and block details directly through email, which saves time and reduces stress. The system also helps exam staff track attendance and match answer sheets quickly.

# Motivation
  The motivation behind this project stemmed from personal experiences during exams, facing challenges like confusion and long queues for seeing seat arrangements on notice boards. ExamMonitor addresses these issues by directly sending seat details to students via email, streamlining the process and reducing exam-time stress. Additionally, students are required to write their seat number and answer sheet number on the sheet paper, but thorugh this project or based scanning removed this burden of students
