 Role: Backend Developer using Spring Boot

 
About the Project 
ExamMonitor is a system that helps manage offline college exams more easily and efficiently using QR codes. We built this project to solve common problems students face during exams—like confusion and long lines to check seat numbers on notice boards.
With ExamMonitor, students get their seat and block details directly through email, which saves time and reduces stress. The system also helps exam staff track attendance and match answer sheets quickly.
